volume_guidelines:
  conservative_approach:

    temple:
      vessels: "Superficial temporal artery"
      risk: "Stroke, blindness, necrosis"
      safety: "Deep injection only, avoid superficial layers"
    
    nasolabial_fold:
      vessels: "Facial artery, angular artery"

  moderate_risk:
    perioral:
      vessels: "Labial arteries"
      risk: "Necrosis, asymmetry"
      safety: "Small volumes, superficial placement"
    
    infraorbital:
      vessels: "Infraorbital artery"
      risk: "Bruising, swelling"
      safety: "Avoid direct vessel area"
